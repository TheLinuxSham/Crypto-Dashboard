# Crypto-Dashboard

## What is the Crypto-Dashboard
The Crypto-Dashboard was a small universitary project to get a feel for python. It uses different APIs to collect data for different crypto currencys:  
> *btc, eth, bnb, ada, xrp, sol, dot, doge, trx, avax*

The program uses python to function. You can download python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
You might also want to check for pip installation with following command in your terminal. If pip is missing you can check this [documentary](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).  
```
pip3 --version
```
